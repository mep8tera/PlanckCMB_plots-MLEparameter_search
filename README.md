Python scripts of my bachelors thesis, creating the Planck CMB TT power spectrum from its sky map, masking the map, carrying out a first order beam correction as well as a 
trivial Maximum Likelihood Estimation for the curvature density parameter and the matter density parameter. Additionally containing figures illustrating the effects of the
universe's curvature on the CMB sky map and its temperature anisotropy power spectrum.
